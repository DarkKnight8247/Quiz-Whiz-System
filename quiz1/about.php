                <legend><h3>Project Overview:</h3></legend>
                <p>The Quiz Whiz system is a fun and engaging quiz application developed as part of a Computer Programming 1 project. It is designed to allow users to test and improve their knowledge in various subjects by answering semi-trivial questions. The system is intended to be both educational and entertaining, providing users with a seamless experience in quizzing themselves on topics they are interested in. </p>

                <legend><h3>Features:</h3></legend>
                <p>The Quiz Whiz system currently offers a selection of three categories for users to choose from:</p>
                <p>
                - Science
                - English
                - Math
                </p>
                <p>Upon selecting a category, users are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions, which test their understanding and knowledge in the chosen field. We also planned to add a timer and difficulty level but since we are only required to make a mini-system we have to change the plan.</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend><h3>Sytem Info:</h3></legend>
                <p>The system is comprised of 6 pages, these are, the start up menu, selection menu, about page (this page), and the remaining 3 are the categories.</p>
                <p>One of the core features of the system is the use of foreach loops. These loops are crucial part to displaying questions and choices dynamically. By using loops to handle the question sets, the system ensures that questions are presented in a flexible and scalable manner, allowing for easy updates or additions to the question database in the future.</p>
